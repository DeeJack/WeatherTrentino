## Abstract

The aim of the project is to create a Knowledge Graph capable to establish a comprehensive and interconnected representation of the factors contributing to climate change within the autonomous province of Trento. This purpose centers on capturing and linking various types of data (geospatial, meteorological, and demographic) over historical time frames, with the goal of illuminating the relationship between human activities, environmental conditions, and resulting climate impacts in this specific region.

By integrating geospatial data, such as that from OpenStreetMap, with historical meteorological records, including temperature trends, air quality metrics, and other environmental indicators, the Knowledge Graph aims to reflect the environmental transformations that have occurred over the years. Additionally, historical demographic data, such as population density, energy consumption, gas usage, water consumption, and waste production, will provide insight into local patterns of resource utilization and waste generation. These variables will collectively inform an understanding of how these human and environmental factors interlink to drive climate change in Trento.

Ultimately, the Knowledge Graph will serve as a tool to clarify the underlying causes of climate change within the context of this region, allowing users to explore the interconnected nature of socio-environmental impacts and aiding in the development of targeted actions or policies to address these issues.
